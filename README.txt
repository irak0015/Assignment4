Number guessing game:
In this game, the user have 5 chances to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each wrong guess, the score is decreased by one and a hint is provided(e.g.: higher or lower). The game is over if the score is at 0.

The idea of the game was inspired by the link provided in the instructions(https://mindmajix.com/python-projects), and was edited by https://chat.openai.com/
